partitionsAndN -
    goes over all trigrams, splits them and counts N
    gets - input file
    will run onse

calcNr4Partition -
    calculates Nr for a given partition
    gets - partitionsAndN output
    will run twice(for each partition)

calcTr4Partition -
    calculates Tr for a given partition
    gets - partitionsAndN output
    will run twice(for each partition)

sumXr4Partition-
   for each trigram, gives it it's appropriate Nr/Tr value in the partition
   gets - partitionsAndN output
             Xr output of partition
    will run 4 times(for each partition and Nr Tr - 2*2)

sumXrTotal - 
    for each word sums its Xr from both partition
    gets - sumXr4Partition 0 and 1
